# WhatCameraDoWeUse
What cameras do we use?


Well, a bunch, and they all have their positives and negatives.

There are many choices, it depends on how much you are willing to spend in hardware for support.

Phone Camera - Starting to be used more, as these cameras can actually look great! Under the correct lighting conditions..

  Pros - Easiest, everyone has one.
  
  Cons - Need phone in a good place with good lighting, and something to hold it, audio is also not very good most of the time.
  

USB -  We started here, simple usb webcams, and found our way to a pair of c920's and c920 Pro's.

  Pros - Simple, plug and play, cheap, quick.
  
  Cons - USB Bandwidth can be exceeded causing issues, camera settings with Logitech had a retaining issue, dark and bright/high
 contrast can be an issue with visibility between colors in high exposure areas (pool ball colors on table).
